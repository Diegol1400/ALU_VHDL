### Project Name: ALU_VHDL

### Description:
The ALU_VHDL project is an implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). The ALU is a fundamental digital component in computing systems that performs arithmetic and logical operations on binary data.

This project provides an implementation of an ALU in VHDL capable of performing a variety of operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, increment, decrement, logical operations such as AND, OR, XOR, as well as bit shifting and rotation.

### Features:
- Implementation of an ALU in VHDL.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Supports logical operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NOR, NAND, XNOR.
- Includes bit shifting and rotation operations.
- Handles special cases such as division by zero and overflow.

### Technologies Used:
- VHDL
- Cyclone II EP2C5T144C8 FPGA

### Installation and Usage:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred VHDL development tool.
3. Compile and simulate the design to verify its functionality.
4. Integrate the design into your main project and configure parameters as necessary.
